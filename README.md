**** CamIR ****

### GETTING STARTED ###

This program has been created to remote a PTZ Tourelle and a FLIR thermal camera.

It can be used with Videotec DTRX3 receiver, or any receiver able to communicate with the Pelco D Protocol.
The thermal camera used during development is a FLIR ThermoVision A40M.


### PREREQUISITES ###

As both devices are remoted through serial port, you will need a computer with 2 serial (DB9) ports.


This program is written for Python 3.6. The best way to use it is by installing Anaconda, and creating a dedicated environment including the following libraries : 

 - PyQt4, for the GUI
 - PySerial, for the communication through serial ports.
 
### HOW TO USE ###

!!!
Please note that, for the moment, the GUI is only for remoting the tourelle.
